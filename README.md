This package provides tools for handling informations for atoms in periodic tables.
The needs differs from case to case, so this package _does not_ focus on giving whole data.
Instead, it focuses on extensibility so that you can add data like atomic weight or metality for yourself.
You can even use this package just for a record type alias `Atoms a`, which has 118 properties corresponding to each element.
